The contract MyToken represents a basic token contract in Solidity. Let's break down the code and explain each part:

Variables:

tokenName (string): This variable stores the name of the token.
tokenAbbrv (string): This variable stores the abbreviation or symbol of the token.
tokenSupply (uint): This variable represents the total supply of tokens in circulation.
balances (mapping): This mapping relates addresses to their respective token balances. It keeps track of how many tokens each address holds.
Constructor:
The constructor is a special function that runs once when the contract is deployed. In your code, the constructor initializes the token details by setting the values of tokenName to "Ember," tokenAbbrv to "EMB," and tokenSupply to 1000000.

Functions:

mint: This function is used to mint or create new tokens and assign them to a specific address. It takes two parameters: _address (the address to which the tokens will be assigned) and _value (the amount of tokens to be minted). Inside the function, it increases the balance of the specified address by adding _value and also increases the total token supply by the same amount.

burn: This function is used to burn or destroy tokens from a specific address. It takes two parameters: _address (the address from which the tokens will be burned) and _value (the amount of tokens to be burned). It first checks if the address has sufficient balance to burn by using the require statement. If the balance is sufficient, it deducts the specified _value from the address's balance and also from the total token supply. It then returns a success message stating that the tokens were burned successfully.

Visibility Modifiers:

public: The variables and mappings declared as public can be accessed from outside the contract, allowing anyone to read their values.
public functions can be called from outside the contract, and their return values and modifications are visible to everyone.
