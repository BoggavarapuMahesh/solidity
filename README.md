CREATING MY OWN TOKEN  
The project involves the creation of a custom token using the Solidity programming language. Tokens are a fundamental aspect of the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, representing digital assets that can be transferred and exchanged. By developing your own token, you can explore the underlying concepts of blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized finance.
Description
The Ember Token Contract enables the creation of the Ember token. The contract consists of the following key components:

Token Details:
The contract stores the details of the Ember token, including its name, abbreviation, and total supply. These details can be accessed publicly.

Address Balances:
The contract maintains a mapping of addresses to token balances, allowing for easy tracking of token ownership and balance for each address.

Minting Tokens:
The contract provides a mint function that enables the creation of new Ember tokens. It takes an address and a value as parameters and increases the total supply by the specified amount. The balance of the recipient address is also increased accordingly.

Burning Tokens:
The contract includes a burn function to remove Ember tokens from circulation. It takes an address and a value as parameters and deducts the specified amount from both the total supply and the balance of the address. It includes conditionals to ensure that the address has a sufficient balance before executing the burn operation.
Getting Started
Executing program
The project will involve the following steps:

Setting up Remix:

Open the Remix IDE in your web browser.
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Creating the Token Contract:
Start a new file in the code editor within Remix. Copy and paste the following code into the file:
''' // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity 0.8.18;

contract MyToken { // public variables here string public Tname = "ember"; string public Tabbrev = "embs"; uint public Ttotal = 0;

// mapping variable here
mapping(address => uint) public Adresstobalance;

// mint function
function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
    Ttotal += _value;
    Adresstobalance[_address] += _value;
}

// burn function
function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
    if (Adresstobalance[_address] >= _value) {
        Ttotal -= _value;
        Adresstobalance[_address] -= _value;
    }
}
}
Compiling the Contract:
Use the Remix compiler panel to compile your token contract.
Select the appropriate compiler version i.e 0.8.18.
Deploying the Contract:
Switch to the "Deploy & run transactions" tab in Remix.
Deploy the compiled contract by clicking the "Deploy" button.
Interacting with the Token:
Utilize the Remix IDE to interact with the deployed token contract.
Use the Addresstobalance, mint and burn functions in the "Deployed Contracts" section to perform actions like transferring tokens, checking balances, and burning tokens.
Input the adress and value and click on the corresponding function buttons to execute our contract.
